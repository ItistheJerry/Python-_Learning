# if else
# Decisions depend on a condition being met
# in Python have execute instruction on a condiiton being met


# the space below if to code is indentation!

# IF/Else/Elif 


# a = int(input("Enter Your age: "))

# if(a>=18):
#     print("You are above the age of Consent! ")

# elif(a<=0):
#     print("Be born first")

# else:
#     print("You are below the age of consent")




# IF/Else/Elif Ladder


# Q write a program to print yes when the age entered by the user is greater than or equal to 18


# RANK = int(input("ENTER RANK TO SECTOR 32:  "))

# if(RANK<=10):
#     print("ACCESS GRANTED :----: WELCOME BOSS!")

# elif(RANK>=10|RANK<=500):
#     print(" ACCESS GRANTED :----; ")

# elif(RANK>=501):
#     print("ACCESS DENIED -- OFFICIALS ONLY")

# else:
#     print("ACCESS DENIED -- CALLING SECURITY")









# Relational Operators
# also called comparrison operator


# used to evaluate conditional inside the if statements, Examples are below

# == : Equal
# >=: Greater than / equal to
# <=: Lesser than / equal to 




# Logical Operators


# these operator on conditional operators
# AND = true if both operands are true
# OR = true if one of the operand is true
# NOT = It reverses the oprands if TRUE then FALSE and vice versa









# ELIf Clause

# means else if and if statements can be chained together with a lot of these elif statements followed by an else statement.
 
 # NOTES
  # Can be any number of elif statements
  # Last else condition is executed if all the condiitions inside elifs fails.

# A string is Immutable and no individual part of it can't be replaced
# String slicing for making individual parts of a string and using it for any purpose
# Example
# name = "Jerry"
# Here Length is 5 Characters and positioned as 
# 0 = J = (-5)
# 1 = E = (-4)
# 2 = R = (-3)
# 3 = R = (-2)
# 4 = Y = (-1)
# forward and backward counting
# nameshort = len(name) = for length

# cutting or slicing words
# nameshort = len(name)
# nameshort = name[0:3] # it starts from 0 to 3 means 0,1,2 will be included
# print(nameshort)
# print(name[-5: -1])
# what if we need only a single character
# character1 = name[1]
# print(character1)


# Slicing with Skip Value
# word = "amazing"

# word[1:6:2]
# print(word)


#advaced slicing

# word = 'amazing'
# word = [ : 7] # word [0:7] = 'amazing'
# word = [0:]  # word [0: 7] = 'amazinf

# a = "0123456789"
# b = a[1:6:2]
# print(b)

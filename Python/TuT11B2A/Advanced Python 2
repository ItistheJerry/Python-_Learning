# Virtual Envirionment

# An Envirionment which is same as the system interpreter but is isolated from the other python envirionments on the system
# virtenv


# PIP FREEZE COMMAND

# to seeing all pip installed library of python


# LAMBDA FUNCTION

# def square(n):
#     return n*n


# print(square(5))




# OR USE LAMBDA

# square = lambda x: x*x
# print(square(5))





# JOIN METHOD COMMAND

# creates a string from iterable objects

# a = ["Jerry", "Mohan", "Mia"]

# final = "::".join(a)
# print(final)







# FORMAT

# Format values inside the string into desired output

# a = "{} is a good {}".format("Jerry", "Boy")
# print(a)






# MAP, FILTER AND REDUCE

# MAP applies a function to all the items in an input_list

# from functools import reduce

# l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# square = lambda x: x*x

# sqlist = map(square, l)
# print(list(sqlist))



# FILTER
# FILTER does what it is named


# def even(n):
#     if (n%2 == 0):
#         return True
#     return False

# onlyEven = filter(even, l)
# print(list(onlyEven))





# REDUCE 
#



# def sum(a, b):
#     return a + b
# mul = lambda x,y:x*y
# print(reduce(sum, l)) 
# print(reduce(mul, l))
# 1+2 = 3 them 3 + 3 = 6 then 6+4 = 10 then 10+5 = 15 will be sum

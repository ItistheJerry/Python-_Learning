# Q1
# a = 1
# b = 2
# print(a+b)


# Q2 Python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z
# a = 34
# b = 5

# print("Remainder when a is divided by b is: ", a % b)


# Q3 Check the type of variable assigned using input () function 
# a = input("Enter a something = ")
# print("The Input in a is: ", a) 
# b = type(a)
# print("Checking variable type")
# print(b)
# or use print(type(a))


# Q4 use Comparison operator to find out whether a given variable a is greater than 'b
# or not take a = 34 and b = 80

# a = int(input("Enter number 1: "))
# b = int(input("Enter number 2: "))
# print("Is A is greater than B: ", a>b)


# Q5 Program to find an average of two numbers entered by the users
# A = int(input("Enter Number 1:  "))
# B = int(input("Enter Number 2:  "))

# print("Number A is: ", A)
# print("Number b is: ", B)
# print("The Average of the two mentioned above numbers is:  ", A + 
#       B / 2)


# Q6 Program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user
# A = int(input("Enter a Number to Produce a Square of:  "))
# print("The Number You Provided is: ", A)
# usually in many programming languages the the square of a variable data is denoted or calculated by A^2 but in python it dosen't recognizes it so in python we use A**2
# print("The Square of that Number is: ", A**2)

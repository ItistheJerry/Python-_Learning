# TYPE CASTING
# Name Given to a memory location is a program
# a = 1 # Integer
# b = 2
# c = 5.22 # Float
# d = "Jerry" # String
# e = False # Boolean
# f = None # None = Nothing in variable  = null
# print(a+b)

# The Main rule for naming variables are and should be meaningfull and easy to target
# not something that causes issues for naming 


# OPERATORS

# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS = + - * /
# ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS = = += -= 
# COMPARISON OPERATORS = == < > >= != Returns Boolean Answers
# LOGICAL OPERATORS = AND OR NOT XOR


# TYPE CASTING
# INTEGER
# FLOAT
# STRING
# NONE
# BOOLEAN


# a = 20
# t = type(a) #class <int>
# print(t)

# b = 20.1
# u = type(b) #class <Float>
# print(u)

# c = "Yoo"
# v = type(c) #class <string>
# print(v)

# d = True
# w = type(d) #class <Boolean>
# print(w)

# e = ''
# x = type(e) #class <none>
# print(x)

# ANy variable can be changed to any variable only if it is possible example
# a = "31.2"
# b = float(a) # a but the type should be float
# t = type(a)
# u = type(b)
# print(t)
# print(u)
# " " anything under double quote is string

# str(32) => "32" integer to string
# int("32") => 32 string to integer
# float(32) => 32.0 integer to float

# While loops
# works as indexing

# for i in range(1,6):
#     print(i)




# While(Condition): Body of the loop
# the block keeps excecuting until the condition is true
# in While loops the condition is checked first. if it evaluates to true the body of the loop is excecuted otherwise not!
# If the loop is entered the process of [condition check and execution] is continued until the condition becomes false





# i = 0
# while i < 50:
#     print("Jerry")
#     i = i + 1

# n = 0
# while n < 50:
#     print(n)
    # i = i + 1



# Write a Program to print 1 to 50 using while loop
# i = 1

# while(i<51):
#     print(i)
#     i += 1








# Q A proram to print the content of a list using while loop
# list = [2, "Jerry", "Samyak", "GunGun", False, 1]

# i = 0

# while(i<len(list)):
#     print(list[i]) 
#     i += 1 










# For Loop

# used to iterate through a sequence like list tuple or string [iterables]

# range makes 0-(n-1) numbers to generate = used to generate a sequence of number

# for i in range(4):
#     print(i)


# (slicing ) 
# for i in range(0, 100, 4):
#     print(i)

# Iteration

# List by for

# l = [1,3,5,7,8865]
# for i in l:
#     print(i)




# list by tuple

# t = (6,65,345,63)
# for i in t:
#     print(i)





# s = "Jerry"
# for i in s:
#     print(i)







# For with Else
# an optional else can be used a for loop if the code is to be excecuted when the loops exhausts.


# l = [1,5,6]
# for item in l:
#     print(item)

# else:
#     print("Done") # This is printed when the loop exhausts






# the break - Continue - pass statements

# the break = used to exit the loop gets out of loop abruptly

# for i in range(100):
    # if(i == 34):
        # break # exit the loop
    # print(i)


# for i in range(100):
#     if(i == 34):
#         continue # skip this iteration
    # print(i)




# Pass Statement

# is a null statement in python
# l = [1,4,6]
# for item in l:
#     pass # without pass the program will throw an error

# print("Pass Done")


# for i in range(1000):
#     pass


# i = 0
# while(i<45):
#     print(i)
#     i+=1

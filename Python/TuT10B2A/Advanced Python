New Features in Python


Walrus operator:-
Allows us to assign values to variables as part of an expression, This operator, names for its resemblance to the eyes and tusks of a walrus, is officially called the assignment expression.

 

 Type Defenation:-
 Type Hints are added using the Colon (:) syntax for variables and the  -> Syntax for function return Types.

# Variable type
 age: int = 25

 # Function type
 def greeting(name: str) -> str:
 return f"Hello, {name}!"



 Advanced Hints:

 # Pythons typing module provides more advanced type hints, such as List, Tuples, Dict, and Union

# We can import List, Tuples, Dict types from the typing module like this:

# from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Union

# # List Of Integers:
# numbers: List[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# # Tuple of a string and an Integer:
# Person: Tuple[str, int] = ("Alice", 30)

# # Dictionary with string keys and integer values:
# scores: Dict[str, int] = {"Alice": 90, "Bob": 85}

# # Union type for variables that can hold multiple types:
# identifier1: Union[int, str] = "ID123"
# identifier2 = 1234 # Also Valid

# print(numbers, Person, scores, identifier1)





 # Match Case:

# Introduced in Python 3.10 introduced the match statement, which is similar to the switch statement found in other programming languages.

# The Basic syntax of the match statement involves matching a variable against several cases using the case keyword.
